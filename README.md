# U.S. Data Center Community Impact Observatory

This repository currently contains the schema-first foundation for the Observatory.
It deliberately does not contain an application scaffold yet.

The initial deliverables are:

- a conceptual data model in `docs/data-model.md`;
- a JSON-only persistence and publication contract in `docs/json-storage-contract.md`;
- versioned JSON Schemas in `schemas/v1/`;
- difficult-case fixtures in `fixtures/v1/`;
- schema and referential-integrity validation in `scripts/validate_data_contract.py`.

Run validation with the bundled or system Python interpreter:

```powershell
python scripts/validate_data_contract.py
```

The validator has no third-party runtime dependency. It checks JSON parsing, schema
catalog integrity, local `$ref` resolution, required top-level fields, fixture
referential integrity, and expected valid/invalid fixture outcomes. Full JSON Schema
validation can be added later to CI with a standards-compliant Draft 2020-12 validator.
